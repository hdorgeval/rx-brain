The modelling of a synapse has been inspired by these videos:

* [Retrograde transport of TfR-GFP in a axon](http://silvermanlab.org/gal_mov_c003.html)
* [Uniform transport of NgCAM-GFP](http://silvermanlab.org/gal_mov_c002.html)
* [Axon outgrowth, Stage 2 to Stage 3 transition](http://silvermanlab.org/gal_mov_c004.html)


in rx-brain project, a synapse is a way to connect a neuron to anything else in the brain.

A synapse is a channel that enables the transport of a data stream from one point to many other points in the brain.

For example, the role of a synapse is to send data generated by a neuron to another neuron or to a collection of other neurons. 

A synapse has one input (basically a neuron) and one to many outputs.

The data received by a synapse is internally handled by an input-channel.
So an input-channel can be seen as a mechanism that connects a synapse with the stream of data generated by a neuron.
